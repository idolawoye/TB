# TB
Tb outbreak study built with nextstrain
Full genomes of the strains were gotten from NCBI which were part of a study conducted by Roetzer et al between 1997 - 2010.
The strains were built with nextrain.org tools Augur and Auspice which can be accessed here: https://github.com/nextstrain/augur and https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice.
